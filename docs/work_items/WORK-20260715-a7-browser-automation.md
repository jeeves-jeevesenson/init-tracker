# A7 Browser-Driven Human-Workflow Automation

Date: `2026-07-15 UTC`

Work item: `WORK-20260715-a7-browser-automation`

Active gate: `A7-G13`

State: `autonomous-host-stabilization-controlled-stop`

Approval: `developer-yolo-host-access-2026-07-16`

## Goal

Establish deterministic browser-driven coverage for the accepted A6
three-surface human workflow while preserving explicit, one-shot gate control.
The bounded G7 harness-ordering correction and G10 set-validation correction
are accepted. G11 passed steps 1 through 17, including the reset contract and
all player/enemy additions, then failed at `start-combat` because the still-open
toolbox intercepted normal pointer events. No combat-start HTTP request was
sent, so this proves a harness interaction defect rather than an application
defect. G12 validated the bounded normal-click correction but reached a
controlled stop before browser execution because port 8787 ownership could not
be verified. The candidate harness/test changes were restored to their
starting bytes. G13 is now running in the developer's externally sandboxed
host-access VM to reapply that correction, perform exact focused validation,
positively verify port ownership, and execute the deterministic workflow. G13
reached a controlled stop after proving that the remaining fixture mismatch is
application-owned and requires additional application-file scope.

The deterministic workflow remains:

1. Open `/dm`, `/dmcontrol`, and `/`.
2. Add all available roster players through `/dm`.
3. Add one of every black-and-tan enemy through `/dm`.
4. Start combat.
5. Complete at least one full round using both attacks and spells.
6. Assert bounded progress with no hangs and consistent visible state across
   `/dm`, `/dmcontrol`, and `/`.
7. Preserve durable, bounded evidence for terminal coordinator consumption.

The approximately-200-enemy multi-target-spell scenario remains unopened as a
separately approved future stress and latency gate.

## Accepted gate history

A7-G1C added the versioned fixture reset and verification contract and the
deterministic three-surface harness foundation. Its browser, server, endpoint,
and target-runtime execution prohibitions remained in force during that
implementation.

A7-G3 was the first accepted one-shot pilot. It failed because the
three-surface executor was not configured: the harness stopped at the
fail-closed executor placeholder before the existing workflow plan ran. No
application defect was proven. Its accepted terminal result remains recorded
in `docs/work_items/A7-G3-pilot-failure-result.md`, and retry remains
unauthorized.

A7-G4 corrected only the executor wiring and focused fake/mock coverage. The
accepted target commit is `19c0446`. Exactly these implementation files
changed:

- `scripts/validation/browser-smoke-harness.py`
- `tests/test_browser_smoke_harness.py`

The registered executor now runs the existing deterministic three-surface
plan once, preserves no-retry behavior, and records terminal evidence.
Failure-detail formatting preserves the outer terminal reason before bounded
subordinate detail.

The accepted validation is:

- `py_compile` passed;
- exactly 14 focused tests passed in `1.69 seconds`; and
- two-file `git diff --check` validation passed.

The accepted G4 result is
`docs/work_items/A7-G4-executor-correction-result.md`.

A7-G5 ran the corrected executor once and ended in a terminal harness-ordering
failure. The plan clicked `#tab-encounter` before operating the setup-panel
roster controls. `#encounterPlayerList` existed, but was hidden after the
encounter tab replaced the setup panel. This proves a harness-ordering defect,
not an application defect. No retry is authorized.

A7-G7 corrected the browser plan at accepted target commit `83ab9e8`. Exactly
these implementation files changed:

- `scripts/validation/browser-smoke-harness.py`
- `tests/test_browser_smoke_harness.py`

The corrected order is `open-toolbox`, `select-all-roster-players`,
`add-all-roster-players`, `open-encounter`, all nine existing enemy-addition
steps, and all remaining steps in their prior relative order. Every setup step
remains single-pass. The fixture contract, selectors, evidence rules,
no-retry behavior, cleanup behavior, CLI behavior, and headless default remain
unchanged.

The accepted validation is:

- `py_compile` passed;
- exactly 16 focused tests passed in `1.68 seconds`; and
- two-file Git diff validation passed.

The accepted G7 result is
`docs/work_items/A7-G7-ordering-correction-result.md`.

A7-G8 received all nine required unique enemy slugs. It failed solely because
the harness required one exact option order even though the actual and
required identity sets matched. No monster-add request occurred before the
terminal failure. No application defect was proven, G8 consumed its one
authorized attempt, and G8 retry remains unauthorized.

A7-G9 recorded that terminal diagnosis and authorized one bounded G10
correction in exactly:

- `scripts/validation/browser-smoke-harness.py`
- `tests/test_browser_smoke_harness.py`

G10 completed that correction at implementation commit `8db48ee`.
Enemy-option presentation order is now ignored. The harness requires the
exact unique identity set. Missing, extra, and duplicate slugs still fail.
Requested slugs are selected by value, and each enemy-addition step clicks
once. All unrelated behavior remains unchanged.

The accepted validation is:

- `py_compile` passed;
- exactly 20 focused tests passed in `1.74 seconds`; and
- two-file diff validation passed.

The accepted G10 result is
`docs/work_items/A7-G10-enemy-option-set-correction-result.md`.

G11 run `20260716_145717` passed the first 17 steps and failed on its single
`start-combat` step after approximately 30 seconds. The button was visible,
enabled, and stable, but `.toolbox-header` intercepted its pointer events while
the toolbox remained open. No start-combat request was emitted. The durable
result is `docs/work_items/A7-G11-pilot-failure-result.md`; no application
defect was proven.

G13 ran two changed-code browser attempts. The first proved and corrected a
harness race: fixture verification began while the successful combat-start
POST was still in flight. The second awaited HTTP 200 from combat start and
then proved an application fixture defect. The live post-start state contains
the required ten PCs and all nine required enemies plus Owl and Raven summons,
but every enemy exposes `monster_slug: null`. The versioned verifier in
`dnd_initative_tracker.py` requires exactly 19 combatants and uses only
`monster_slug` to classify enemies, so it returned `ui_setup_mismatch` with
actual counts 21 players, zero enemies, and 21 total. The durable result is
`docs/work_items/A7-G13-autonomous-host-stabilization-result.md`.

```

G13 is closed. The unaccepted harness/test candidates were restored to their
starting bytes, the owned server was cleaned up safely, and all implementation,
test, browser, runtime, localhost, and network authorization is closed. Push,
deployment, scheduler, production, restart, and service mutation remain
unauthorized.

## Next safe action

Developer/orchestrator review and preparation of a new bounded application
correction for `dnd_initative_tracker.py` with focused coverage in
`tests/test_server_runtime.py`. The correction must reconcile the versioned
fixture's exact identity contract with normal post-start summons and missing
runtime `monster_slug` values before another browser gate is opened.
