# Player Character YAML Files

This directory contains YAML files that define player characters for use in the D&D Initiative Tracker application. These files serve as persistent character sheets that can be created, edited, and loaded by both the character builder GUI (`scripts/skeleton_gui.py`) and the main initiative tracker application (`dnd_initative_tracker.py`).

## Overview

Player character YAML files provide a structured, human-readable format for storing complete D&D 5e character sheets. These files are:

- **Persistent**: Character data is saved to disk and preserved between game sessions
- **Editable**: Can be edited manually in a text editor or via the GUI character builder
- **Integrated**: Automatically loaded by the initiative tracker for combat management
- **Extensible**: Support for custom features, resources, spells, and actions
- **Version Controlled**: Include a `format_version` field for future compatibility

For the planned standalone web shop/inventory model freeze, see `docs/shop_inventory_design.md`.

### Key Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Player data is separate from the application logic
2. **Portability**: YAML files can be shared, backed up, and version controlled
3. **Flexibility**: Supports complex character builds with multi-classing, custom features, and homebrew content
4. **Formula Support**: Many fields accept mathematical formulas (e.g., `"10 + dex_mod"`) for dynamic calculations

---

## File Format

- **Format**: YAML (`.yaml` or `.yml` extension)
- **Location**: `players/` directory in the application root
- **Naming Convention**: Typically `Character-Name.yaml` (e.g., `Fred-Figglehorn.yaml`)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with support for unicode characters
- **Current Version**: `format_version: 2`

---

## Complete YAML Structure Reference

### Root Level Fields

These fields appear at the top level of the YAML file:

```yaml
format_version: 2          # Required: File format version for compatibility
name: "Character Name"     # Required: Character's name (used for display and filename generation)
player: "Player Name"      # Optional: Real-world player's name
campaign: "Campaign Name"  # Optional: Campaign identifier
ip: "192.168.1.100"       # Optional: Player's IP address for LAN features
summon_on_start:          # Optional: Auto-spawn summons when this PC is added to combat
  - monster: owl.yaml
    count: 1
controlled_pc: "Fred"     # Optional: Additional PC this character can control on that PC's turn in LAN UI
prepared_wild_shapes:      # Optional: Druid-only prepared wild shape beast IDs
  - wolf
  - brown-bear
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- **format_version**: Tracks the schema version of the YAML file. Current version is `2`. Used for future migration and backward compatibility.
- **name**: The character's in-game name. This is the primary identifier used throughout the application. Required field.
- **player**: The real-world player's name. Used for tracking who plays this character.
- **campaign**: Optional campaign name or identifier. Useful for organizing characters across multiple campaigns.
- **ip**: IP address for the player's device when using LAN/mobile client features. Can be manually set or auto-detected.
- **summon_on_start** (alias: `summon-on-start`, `summons_on_start`, `summons-on-start`): Optional startup summons. Supports shorthand string, a single mapping, or a list of entries. Each entry uses `monster`, optional `count`, and optional overrides.
- **controlled_pc** (alias: `controlled-pc`): Optional PC name that this claimed player can also control on that PC’s turn in the LAN client.
- **prepared_wild_shapes**: Optional list of beast IDs (for Druid level 2+) used by LAN Wild Shape management. Legacy `learned_wild_shapes` is still read for backward compatibility, but new saves use `prepared_wild_shapes`.

Startup summon examples:

```yaml
# Shorthand (defaults to count=1, no overrides)
summon-on-start: owl.yaml

# Single mapping entry
summon_on_start:
  monster: owl
  count: 1
  name: "Eldramar's Familiar"
  hp: 7
  ac: 13
  dex: 16
  wis: 14

# List form
summon_on_start:
  - owl.yaml
  - monster: wolf.yaml
    count: 2
    overrides:
      name: "Pack Wolf"
      speed: "40 ft."
```

### Identity Section

Contains role-playing and character identity information:

```yaml
identity:
  pronouns: "He/Him"           # Character's pronouns
  ancestry: "Human"            # Race/species/ancestry
  background: "Soldier"        # Character background
  alignment: "Lawful Good"     # Alignment (e.g., Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral)
  description: "A tall warrior with a scarred face"  # Physical description
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- **pronouns**: Character's preferred pronouns (e.g., "She/Her", "They/Them", "He/Him", custom pronouns)

---

### Leveling Section

Defines character level and class information:

```yaml
leveling:
  level: 5                  # Total character level (sum of all class levels)
  classes:                  # List of classes (supports multiclassing)
    - name: "Fighter"       # Class name
      subclass: "Champion"  # Subclass/archetype name
      level: 3              # Levels in this class
      attacks_per_action: 2 # Optional non-spell melee/ranged attacks per Attack action
    - name: "Rogue"
      subclass: "Thief"
      level: 2
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- **level**: Total character level across all classes. Must equal the sum of individual class levels.
- **classes**: List of class objects. Supports multiclassing with multiple entries.
  - **name**: The class name (e.g., Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
  - **subclass**: Subclass or archetype name (e.g., Champion, Battle Master, Assassin, Arcane Trickster)
  - **level**: Number of levels in this specific class (1-20)
  - **attacks_per_action**: Optional non-spell melee/ranged attacks granted by this class when taking the Attack action (defaults to `1` if omitted)

**Notes:**
- For single-class characters, include one class entry with `level` matching total character level
- For multiclass characters, sum of class levels must equal total `level`
- Subclass can be empty string if character hasn't chosen a subclass yet
- When multiple classes set `attacks_per_action`, the tracker uses the highest configured value for LAN attack request defaults

### Abilities Section

The six core ability scores:

```yaml
abilities:
  str: 16    # Strength
  dex: 14    # Dexterity
  con: 15    # Constitution
  int: 10    # Intelligence
  wis: 12    # Wisdom
  cha: 8     # Charisma

### Vitals Section

Health, movement, and key combat statistics:

```yaml

    die: "d10"                    # Hit die type (d6, d8, d10, d12)
    total: 5                      # Total number of hit dice (usually equals level)
    spent: 2                      # Number of hit dice spent (refreshes on long rest)
  speed:
    walk: 30                      # Walking speed in feet
    climb: 15                     # Climbing speed (0 if none)
    fly: 0                        # Flying speed (0 if none)
    swim: 30                      # Swimming speed (0 if none)
  initiative:
    formula: "dex_mod"            # Formula for initiative calculation
  passive_perception:
    formula: "10 + wis_mod"       # Formula for passive Perception
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- **max_hp**: Maximum hit points. Calculate as: `(hit_die_average + con_mod) * level + additional_hp`
  - First level gets max hit die + CON mod
  - Subsequent levels get average (or rolled) + CON mod
- **current_hp**: Current hit points. Updated during combat.
- **temp_hp**: Temporary hit points. These are lost first before current HP.
- **hit_dice**: Hit dice for short rest healing
  - **die**: Type of hit die based on class (Wizard: d6, Rogue: d8, Fighter: d10, Barbarian: d12)
  - **total**: Total hit dice available (typically equals character level for single-class)
  - **spent**: How many hit dice have been spent (reset on long rest)
- **speed**: Movement speeds in feet per round (numeric values)
  - **walk**: Standard walking speed (typically 30 for most races, 25 for dwarves/small races)
  - **climb**: Special climbing speed (from racial traits or class features)
  - **fly**: Flying speed (from racial traits, magic items, or spells)
  - **swim**: Swimming speed (from racial traits or class features)
- **initiative.formula**: Formula for calculating initiative. Typically `"dex_mod"` but can be modified by features (e.g., Champion Fighter adds `"dex_mod + wis_mod"`)
- **passive_perception.formula**: Formula for passive Perception. Standard is `"10 + wis_mod"` plus proficiency if proficient in Perception, plus expertise bonus if applicable.

**Notes:**
- Hit dice: Multiclass characters have separate hit dice types. The `die` field can be a single type or the primary class's type.
- Formulas are evaluated by the application using character stats (see [Formula System](#formula-system))
- For `format_version: 2` files, `vitals.speed` uses the `walk/climb/fly/swim` keys with integer values representing feet.
- Legacy character files that still use `Normal/Climb/Fly/Swim` keys are normalized by the UI to the new schema on load.

### Attacks Section

Combat attack modifiers and optional reusable weapon presets. Weapon presets can be fully embedded, or minimal (`id` + optional overrides) and resolved from `Items/Weapons/*.yaml` and (for magic weapons) `Items/Magic_Items/*.yaml` at runtime:

```yaml
attacks:
  melee_attack_mod: 5
  ranged_attack_mod: 4
  weapon_to_hit: 5
  weapons:
    - id: "longsword"
      name: "Longsword"
      proficient: true
      to_hit: 7
      range: "5"
      one_handed:
        damage_formula: "1d8 + str_mod"
        damage_type: "slashing"
      two_handed:
        damage_formula: "1d10 + str_mod"
        damage_type: "slashing"

- **Minimal preset pattern**: You can define only `id` plus selective overrides (for example custom `to_hit`, `magic_bonus`, or damage formula).
  - **id**: Stable key for references and future automation. If only `id` is provided, base fields are resolved from Items and then your overrides are applied (fill-missing-only).
  - **name**: Display name for the weapon.
  - **proficient**: Whether proficiency is included when computing to-hit (player-specific; do not set this in `Items/Weapons/*.yaml`).
  - **to_hit**: Explicit attack bonus for this preset.
  - **magic_bonus** / **item_bonus**: Optional flat +1/+2 style bonus applied on top of `to_hit`.
  - **range**: Optional melee/ranged reach in feet (or normal/long like `20/60`; LAN attack overlay uses the first value).
  - **one_handed** / **two_handed**: Optional damage mode metadata.
    - **damage_formula**: Damage expression such as `"1d8 + str_mod"`.
    - **damage_type**: Damage type string.
  - **effect**: Optional structured metadata for on-hit rider tracking.
    - **on_hit**: Short freeform effect description.
    - **save_ability**: Optional save ability key (`str`, `dex`, `con`, `int`, `wis`, `cha`).

### Resources Section

Global resource pools for tracking limited-use abilities:

```yaml
resources:
  pools:
    - id: "action_surge"          # Unique identifier
      label: "Action Surge"       # Display name
      current: 1                  # Current uses remaining
      max_formula: "1"            # Formula for maximum uses
      reset: "short_rest"         # When pool resets
    - id: "second_wind"
      label: "Second Wind"
      current: 0
      max_formula: "1"
      reset: "short_rest"
    - id: "superiority_dice"
      label: "Superiority Dice"
      current: 4
      max_formula: "4"
      reset: "short_rest"
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- **pools**: List of resource pool objects
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the pool (used for referencing in features and actions)
  - **label**: Display name shown in UI
  - **current**: Current number of uses remaining
  - **max_formula**: Formula for calculating maximum uses (can be a number or formula like `"level // 2"`)

- Combat abilities (Action Surge, Superiority Dice, Bardic Inspiration)
- Spell slots (can be tracked here or in spellcasting section)
- Racial traits with limited uses (Breath Weapon, Stone's Endurance)
- Custom abilities and homebrew features

**Notes:**
- Resource pools defined here are "global" and available at character level
- Features can also define their own resource pools (see [Features Section](#features-section))
- The initiative tracker can consume and restore these pools during gameplay

---

### Features Section

The most complex section - defines character features, abilities, and their grants:

```yaml
features:
  - id: "sneak_attack"            # Unique identifier
    name: "Sneak Attack"          # Display name
    category: "class"             # Feature category
    source: "Rogue 1"             # Where feature comes from
    description: "Deal extra damage when you have advantage or an ally is nearby."
    grants:                       # What this feature provides
      pools: []                   # Resource pools granted by this feature
      spells:                     # Spells granted by this feature
        cantrips: []              # Cantrips added to spellcasting
        casts: []                 # Spell casts granted (independent of spell slots)
      actions: []                 # Actions granted
      modifiers: []               # Stat modifiers granted
      damage_riders: []           # Additional damage granted
```

Each feature can have multiple nested components. Let's examine each `grants` subsection:

#### Feature Pools

Resource pools specific to a feature:

```yaml
grants:
  pools:
    - id: "sneak_attack_dice"
      label: "Sneak Attack Dice"
      max_formula: "ceil(level / 2)"  # Scales with level
      reset: "never"
```

#### Feature Spells

Spells granted by the feature:

```yaml
grants:
  spells:
    cantrips:                     # Cantrips added to known cantrips
      - "mage-hand"
      - "prestidigitation"
    casts:                        # Spell casts (free or resource-consuming)
      - spell: "misty-step"       # Spell identifier
        action_type: "bonus_action"
        consumes:                 # Optional: Resource cost
          pool: "ki_points"
          cost: 2
      - spell: "detect-magic"
        action_type: "action"
        consumes:
          pool: "spell_slots_1"
          cost: 1
```

LAN client behavior for `consumes.pool` grants:
- Pool-granted spells appear in cast presets even if not prepared.
- Casting consumes the configured resource pool first (not spell slots).
- If the pool is exhausted, free-only grants disappear until the pool is restored.
- If a spell is both prepared and pool-granted, casts use the pool while available, then fall back to normal slots.
- The LAN sheet shows a **Resource Pools** panel with `current/max` values.

**Field Descriptions:**
- **cantrips**: List of cantrip IDs added to character's known cantrips
- **casts**: List of spell cast objects
  - **spell**: Spell identifier (matches spell YAML filename in `Spells/` directory)
  - **action_type**: Type of action to cast ("action", "bonus_action", "reaction", "minute", etc.)
  - **consumes**: Optional resource consumption
    - **pool**: ID of resource pool to consume from
    - **cost**: Number of resources to consume per cast

#### Feature Actions

Actions granted by the feature:

```yaml
grants:
  actions:
    - name: "Stunning Strike"

      uses:                       # Optional: Limited uses
        pool: "ki_points"
        cost: 1
    - name: "Patient Defense"

    description: "You can take a bonus action only when a feature, spell, or ability says you can."
    type: "bonus_action"
```

New characters start with the full basic list above; you can add or remove entries as needed.

**Field Descriptions:**

These sections provide an alternative way to define actions without using the features system:

- **name**: Name of the action
- **description**: What the action does
- **type**: Action type (`"action"`, `"reaction"`, or `"bonus_action"`)

**Notes:**
- These are simpler than feature-granted actions (no resource tracking)
- Best for actions that are always available or don't consume resources
- For complex actions with resource management, use the features system instead

```yaml
spellcasting:
  enabled: true                   # Whether character is a spellcaster

- Spell slot usage is tracked during combat and can be modified in real-time

**Notes:**
- Use `casting_mod` in formulas - it automatically references the specified casting ability modifier
- Spell IDs should match spell filenames (typically kebab-case)
- The application validates spell IDs against available spell YAML files

---

### Inventory Section

Currency and item management:

```yaml
inventory:
  currency:
    gp: 150                       # Gold pieces
    sp: 25                        # Silver pieces
    cp: 8                         # Copper pieces
  items:
    - id: "longsword"
      instance_id: "longsword__001"
      name: "Longsword"
      quantity: 1
      description: "A well-crafted longsword."
    - id: "lesser_healing_potion"
      instance_id: "lesser_healing_potion_stack"
      name: "Lesser Healing Potion"
      quantity: 3
      description: "Restores 2d4+2 hit points."
    - name: "Rope, Hempen (50 feet)"
      quantity: 1
      description: "Standard adventuring rope."
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- **currency**: Monetary wealth
  - **gp**: Gold pieces
  - **sp**: Silver pieces
  - **cp**: Copper pieces
  - Note: Can also track `pp` (platinum pieces), `ep` (electrum pieces) if desired
- **items**: List of inventory items
  - **id**: Catalog/reference item identifier (matches entries in `Items/*`)
    - For owned equippables that map to `Items/Weapons` or `Items/Armor`, include canonical registry `id`
    - Temporary/custom mundane entries may remain name-only until a registry definition exists
  - **instance_id**: Stable owned-item instance identifier (canonical per-entry identity)
    - Required for unique/equippable owned items (weapons, armor, shields, attunable gear)
  - **name**: Item name
  - **quantity**: Number of items
  - **description**: Item description or notes
  - **equipped**: Equipped flag stored on the owned item instance
  - **equipped_slot**: Optional hand-slot assignment for owned weapons (`main_hand` or `off_hand`)
  - **selected_mode**: Optional weapon usage mode (`one` or `two`) for versatile/two-handed behavior

**Notes:**
- Inventory-backed consumables (currently healing potions) are used in combat mechanics
- Consumable pool displays in LAN are derived from `inventory.items[].quantity`
- Consumable counts are **not** persisted as writable `resources.pools`; inventory is authoritative
- Magic item ownership/state now lives on `inventory.items[]` entries (`id`, `instance_id`, `equipped`, `attuned`)
- Weapon hand selection is now an inventory-owned per-instance state (`equipped_slot` + `selected_mode`), replacing transient UI-only hand selection over time
- `id` identifies *what* the item is; `instance_id` identifies *which owned copy* it is
- Registry-backed `id` values on owned equippables are the target shape for standardized equipment behavior
- Non-stackable/equippable owned items should always define explicit `instance_id` in YAML
- Stackable consumables may be represented as one stack entry with quantity; optional `instance_id` is allowed for stack-level state

---

### Magic Item State in Inventory

Attunable/equippable magic item configuration is stored directly on owned inventory entries.

```yaml
inventory:
  items:
    - id: bahamuts_rebuking_claw
      instance_id: bahamuts_rebuking_claw__001
      name: Bahamut's Rebuking Claw
      quantity: 1
      equipped: true
      attuned: true
      state:
        pools:
          - id: bahamuts_rebuking_claw
            label: Bahamut's Rebuking Claw
            current: 1
            max: 1
            max_formula: "1"
            reset: long_rest
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- **id**: Magic item ID (must match YAML in `Items/Magic_Items`)
- **instance_id**: Unique owned instance key used by inventory mutations and shop purchase records
- **equipped**: Whether the owned item is currently equipped
- **attuned**: Whether the owned item is currently attuned
- **equipped_slot**: Optional hand slot for weapon-shaped magic items (`main_hand` / `off_hand`)
- **selected_mode**: Optional mode for weapon-shaped magic items (`one` / `two`)
- **state.pools**: Persistent charge/resource state for this owned magic item instance
  - Item-granted pools/charges are stored here (not in top-level `resources.pools`)
  - Runtime only projects these pools while item is active (`equipped`, and `attuned` if required)

**Magic item YAML format (`Items/Magic_Items/*.yaml`)**

```yaml
id: bahamuts_rebuking_claw
name: Bahamut's Rebuking Claw
requires_attunement: true
grants:
  spells:
    casts:
      - spell: polymorph
        action_type: reaction
        consumes:
          pool: bahamuts_rebuking_claw
          cost: 1
```

If `requires_attunement: true`, the owned inventory item must be marked `attuned: true` to grant effects.

---

### Notes Section

Freeform notes storage:

```yaml
notes:
  backstory: "Grew up in the slums of Waterdeep, learned to survive by wit and blade."
  personality: "Quick with a joke, slow to trust, always looking for the angle."
  goals: "Find the person who betrayed my mentor and bring them to justice."
  dm_notes: "Has a mysterious patron watching from the shadows."
```

**Field Descriptions:**

The `notes` section is a flexible dictionary for storing any additional character information:
- Keys can be any string (e.g., `"backstory"`, `"personality"`, `"goals"`, `"dm_notes"`)
- Values are freeform text
- Not used by application logic - purely for player/DM reference

**Common Use Cases:**
- Character backstory and history
- Personality traits, ideals, bonds, flaws
- Character goals and motivations
- DM-specific notes and secrets
- Session recaps or important story events
- Relationships with NPCs and other PCs

## How Character Files Are Used

### Character Builder GUI (`scripts/skeleton_gui.py`)

The character builder is a **Tkinter-based wizard application** for creating and editing character YAML files.

#### Features:

1. **Multi-Page Wizard**: 8 pages guiding users through character creation
   - Setup: Load existing characters or create new
   - Basics: Name, player, identity information
   - Level & Abilities: Class levels and ability scores
   - Vitals: HP, hit dice, speeds, formulas
   - Resources: Global resource pool management
   - Spellcasting: Full spellcasting configuration
   - Features: Complex feature editor with pools, spells, actions, modifiers, damage riders
   - Review/Save: YAML preview and save

2. **State Persistence**: Pages remember input when navigating back/forth

3. **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds spell directories and existing characters

4. **YAML I/O**:
   - Load: `yaml.safe_load()` with defensive default merging
   - Save: `yaml.safe_dump()` to `players/` directory
   - Auto-generates filename from character name

5. **Validation**: Each page validates input before advancing

#### Usage:

```bash
# Run the character builder
python scripts/skeleton_gui.py

# The GUI will:
# 1. Show setup page with list of existing characters
# 2. Click "New Character" to start from scratch
# 3. Click character name to load and edit existing character
# 4. Navigate through pages using "Next" and "Back" buttons
# 5. Save from Review/Save page or "File → Save" menu
```

#### Key Methods:

- `load_character(path)`: Load YAML file into editor
- `save_current()`: Save character to `players/` directory
- `save_as()`: Save with new filename
- `new_character()`: Reset and start fresh character
- `show_page(idx)`: Navigate between wizard pages

**Best Practice**: Use the GUI for creating characters to ensure proper structure and validation. Manual editing is possible but requires understanding the complete schema.

---

### Initiative Tracker Application (`dnd_initative_tracker.py`)

The main application uses character YAML files during gameplay for combat tracking and character management.

#### How Characters Are Loaded:

1. **Auto-Discovery**: Application scans `players/` directory for all `.yaml` and `.yml` files
2. **Caching**: Implements file stat metadata caching to avoid re-parsing unchanged files
3. **Parsing**: Uses `yaml.safe_load()` to load character data
4. **Roster**: Characters are added to the available roster and can be seeded into initiative

#### Character Data Usage During Combat:

**Initiative & Combat:**
- **Auto-Seeding**: Characters can be automatically added to initiative order from roster
- **Initiative Rolls**: Uses `initiative.formula` for calculating initiative (typically `dex_mod`)
- **Turn Tracking**: Tracks current turn, round count, and turn count

**Vitals & Resources:**
- **HP Tracking**: Monitors `current_hp`, `max_hp`, and `temp_hp`
- **Resource Pools**: Tracks usage of limited resources (Action Surge, Ki Points, Spell Slots, etc.)
- **Movement**: Uses `speed.Normal`, `speed.Fly`, etc. for battle map movement tracking
- **Actions**: Tracks actions, bonus actions, and reactions per turn

**Combat Capabilities:**
- **Ability Scores**: Calculates attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks using ability modifiers
- **AC**: Determines armor class from `defenses.ac` sources and bonuses
- **Saving Throws**: Uses proficiency data for saving throw calculations
- **Resistances/Immunities**: Applies damage resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities

**Spellcasting:**
- **Spell Lists**: Loads known spells, prepared spells, and cantrips
- **Spell Slots**: Manages spell slot usage during combat
- **Spell Attack/Save DC**: Calculates using formulas from character data
- **Spell Modifications**: Saves spell configuration changes back to YAML file

**LAN/Mobile Client:**
- **Character Data Sync**: Sends character profiles to mobile clients via WebSocket
- **Token Colors**: Saves custom token colors back to character YAML
- **Player Control**: Players can view their character stats, spells, and actions on mobile devices

#### Persistence:

Character modifications during gameplay are saved back to YAML files:
- **Spell Configuration**: Changes to prepared spells are persisted
- **Token Customization**: Custom token colors saved to character file
- **Resource Usage**: Can optionally save resource pool states between sessions

#### Usage Flow:

```
1. Application starts → Scans players/ directory
2. Character YAML files loaded into roster
3. DM seeds characters into initiative order
4. Combat begins:
   - HP damage/healing tracked
   - Resources consumed
   - Spells cast (slots consumed)
   - Movement tracked on battle map
5. End of combat:
   - Optional: Save character state
   - Spell configurations auto-saved
```

## Creating and Editing Characters

### Method 1: Character Builder GUI (Recommended)

Use the character builder for a guided experience:

```bash
python scripts/skeleton_gui.py
```

**Advantages:**
- Guided wizard with validation
- Visual spell picker with search
- Feature editor with tabs for pools/spells/actions/modifiers/damage
- YAML preview before saving
- Error checking

### Method 2: Manual Editing

Edit YAML files directly in a text editor:

1. **Create New File**: Start with Fred-Figglehorn.yaml as a template
2. **Copy Structure**: Duplicate the file and rename it
3. **Edit Fields**: Modify values as needed
4. **Validate**: Ensure YAML syntax is correct (use a YAML validator)
5. **Test**: Load character in the initiative tracker to verify

**Tips for Manual Editing:**
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces, no tabs)
- Quote strings that contain special characters or start with numbers
- Validate formulas use correct variable names (e.g., `dex_mod`, `prof`, `level`)
- Reference spell IDs correctly (match spell YAML filenames)
- Maintain proper YAML list syntax (hyphens for list items)

### Method 3: Copy and Modify Template

Use Fred-Figglehorn.yaml as a template:

```bash
cd players/
cp Fred-Figglehorn.yaml My-Character.yaml
# Edit My-Character.yaml
```

---

## Formula System

Many fields support mathematical formulas that are evaluated dynamically based on character stats.

### Available Variables:

- **Ability Modifiers**: `str_mod`, `dex_mod`, `con_mod`, `int_mod`, `wis_mod`, `cha_mod`
- **Ability Scores**: `str`, `dex`, `con`, `int`, `wis`, `cha`
- **Character Level**: `level`
- **Proficiency Bonus**: `prof`
- **Spellcasting**: `casting_mod` (references the ability specified in `spellcasting.casting_ability`)

### Formula Examples:

```yaml
# Simple ability modifier reference
initiative: "dex_mod"

# Spell save DC
save_dc_formula: "8 + prof + casting_mod"

# Passive Perception
passive_perception: "10 + wis_mod"

# Multiclass spellcaster prepared spells
max_formula: "int_mod + level // 2"

# Unarmored Defense (Barbarian)
base_formula: "10 + dex_mod + con_mod"

# Unarmored Defense (Monk)
base_formula: "10 + dex_mod + wis_mod"

# Ki Points (scales with level)
max_formula: "level"

# Sneak Attack Dice (scales every 2 levels)
max_formula: "ceil(level / 2)"

# Prepared spells (full caster)
max_formula: "casting_mod + level"

# Prepared spells (half caster like Paladin)
max_formula: "cha_mod + max(1, level // 2)"
```

### Supported Operations:

- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (integer division), `%` (modulo)
- **Functions**: `min()`, `max()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, `abs()`
- **Comparison**: Can be used in conditional formulas (advanced usage)

### Formula Evaluation:

Formulas are evaluated by the application at runtime:
1. Character stats are extracted from the YAML file
2. Ability modifiers are calculated: `(score - 10) // 2`
3. Formula string is evaluated using the character's current stats
4. Result is used for the corresponding mechanic (AC, initiative, etc.)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive IDs

Use clear, unique identifiers for pools, features, and resources:

```yaml
# Good
id: "action_surge"
id: "ki_points"
id: "bardic_inspiration"

# Bad
id: "pool1"
id: "feature_a"
id: "thing"
```

### 2. Document Complex Features

Use the `description` field to explain what features do:

```yaml
- id: "portent"
  name: "Portent"
  category: "subclass"
  source: "Divination Wizard 2"
  description: "Roll 2d20 at the start of the day. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check with one of these foretelling rolls. You can do so after the roll is made but before the outcome is determined."
```

### 3. Organize Features by Category

Group features by source for easier reading:

```yaml
features:
  # Class Features
  - id: "rage"
    category: "class"
  - id: "reckless_attack"
    category: "class"
  
  # Subclass Features
  - id: "frenzy"
    category: "subclass"
  
  # Racial Traits
  - id: "darkvision"
    category: "racial"
  
  # Feats
  - id: "great_weapon_master"
    category: "feat"
```

### 4. Keep Formulas Simple

Use simple, readable formulas:

```yaml
# Good
max_formula: "level"
max_formula: "wis_mod + level"

# Acceptable
max_formula: "ceil(level / 2)"

# Avoid overly complex
max_formula: "max(1, (level // 2) + (wis_mod if wis_mod > 0 else 0))"
```

### 5. Use Standard Spell IDs

Match spell IDs to the spell filenames in the `Spells/` directory:

```yaml
# Spell file: Spells/magic-missile.yaml
known:
  - "magic-missile"  # Correct

# Spell file: Spells/fireball.yaml
known:
  - "fireball"  # Correct
  - "fire-ball"  # Incorrect (hyphen placement)
```

### 6. Validate Before Using

Always test new characters in the application:

1. Load the character in the initiative tracker
2. Verify all calculations are correct (AC, saves, etc.)
3. Check that spells load properly
4. Test resource pools function as expected
5. Verify features appear correctly

### 7. Keep Backups

Save backup copies of character files:

```bash
# Create backups directory
mkdir -p players/backups

# Back up character before major changes
cp players/My-Character.yaml players/backups/My-Character-backup-2026-01-30.yaml
```

### 8. Version Control

If using git, commit character files:

```bash
git add players/My-Character.yaml
git commit -m "Update My Character - added new spells and level 5 features"
```

---

## Example Character

Here's a complete example character demonstrating all major sections:

```yaml
format_version: 2
name: "Aria Shadowstep"

## Summary

Player character YAML files are the persistent storage format for D&D 5e characters in this initiative tracker system. They provide:

- **Complete Character Data**: All stats, abilities, spells, features, and inventory
- **Formula Support**: Dynamic calculations based on character stats
- **Extensibility**: Support for homebrew content and custom features
- **Integration**: Seamless loading by both the character builder GUI and initiative tracker
- **Human-Readable**: YAML format is easy to read and edit manually

The schema is comprehensive yet flexible, supporting everything from simple martial characters to complex multiclass spellcasters with custom features and homebrew abilities.

For best results:
1. Use the character builder GUI (`scripts/skeleton_gui.py`) for initial creation
2. Refer to this README and Fred-Figglehorn.yaml as examples
3. Test characters in the initiative tracker before gameplay
4. Keep backups of character files
5. Use version control for tracking changes over time

- `Fred-Figglehorn.yaml` - Example character file
- `dnd_initative_tracker.py` - Main application that uses these files

## Web Builder UX (Tabbed Form + Autofill)

The `/new_character` and `/edit_character` web forms now use a tabbed layout to group related fields:

- **Basic Info**: root + identity fields and YAML filename controls.
- **Stats**: leveling, abilities, proficiency, defenses, attacks.
- **Vitals**: HP/speed/resources.
- **Feats**: feature list/objects.
- **Actions**: actions, reactions, bonus actions.
- **Spellcasting**: spellcasting fields with a large enabled/disabled toggle button.
- **War Caster (reaction casting)**: add a feat entry named `War Caster` in the **Feats** tab (or `features[]` in YAML). The LAN reaction picker will then show a War Caster flow that only lists prepared spells eligible for War Caster use (action cast time, non-AoE, single-target targeting config) and lets the player pick an enemy target (defaults to the current active enemy when available).
- **Reaction Manager (LAN)**: the **Reactions** button opens a reaction manager where each reaction can be set to `Off`, `Ask`, or `Auto`, and each listed reaction can still be triggered manually with **Use now**. Preferences are stored in browser localStorage per claimed character and synced to the server so prompt suppression is honored server-side.
- **Sentinel feat (2024)**: add a feature in `features[]` with `name: Sentinel` or `id: Sentinel` (case-insensitive). This enables Sentinel Guardian reaction prompts in LAN on:
  - a nearby hostile creature using **Disengage** (within 8 ft),
  - a nearby hostile creature hitting someone other than the Sentinel (within 8 ft).
- **Sentinel Halt**: when a Sentinel opportunity attack hits, the target's speed is reduced to 0 for the rest of that target's current turn.

### Auto-calculated behavior

- **Filename default** uses snake_case from character name (`John Twilight` -> `john_twilight.yaml`).
- **Ability modifiers** are calculated from ability scores with `(score - 10) // 2`.
- **Proficiency bonus** auto-scales by level bands (2/3/4/5/6 for levels 1-4/5-8/9-12/13-16/17+).
- **Saving throw proficiencies** are auto-applied from the **highest-level class** and can still be manually added.
- **Hit dice** derive from class levels in multiclass builds.
- **Tool/weapon/armor proficiencies** are expected to be selected from dropdown/list controls (instead of free-text typing) in the web UI.

When YAML is exported/saved, all schema sections are still included even if some tabs were never opened.

## Wild Shape Runtime Notes

- Druid characters (level 2+) automatically receive a `wild_shape` resource pool at load time.
- This pool is normalized to:
  - `label: Wild Shape`
  - `max_formula: max(2, min(4, 2 + floor(druid_level / 3)))`
  - `reset: long_rest`
  - `gain_on_short: 1`
- Wild Shape prepared/known form IDs can now be persisted in YAML via `prepared_wild_shapes` (legacy `learned_wild_shapes` is still accepted on read).
- Wild Shape overlays (beast form stats, token rename/size/speed changes) remain **runtime state** and are not written back to the player YAML file.
- Long rest clears active Wild Shape overlays and refreshes Wild Shape/LAN exchange restrictions.
- **Feats tab is now a two-pane editor** (searchable feat list on the left, explicit details/save/revert/remove actions on the right) with per-feat dirty indicators and unsaved-change confirmation when switching feats/tabs or leaving the page.
- **Configure Grants… modal** replaces inline grants editing. It contains dedicated **Resource Pools** and **Granted Spells** sub-tabs, supports add/remove/edit flows, validates pool ID uniqueness across the character, and only applies changes when confirmed.
- **Pool materialization is automatic on grants Apply/save/export/overwrite**: feat-local `grants.pools[]` definitions are synchronized into `resources.pools[]` so `consumes.pool` references remain backend-valid.
- **Granted spell action types** in feat grant configuration are auto-inferred from spell `casting_time` metadata (with Action fallback warning when metadata is missing), and consumes-pool rows use the same spell catalog source as the main spellcasting tab.

### Web editor proficiency and derived tracker behavior

The `/new_character` and `/edit_character` web editors now expose canonical proficiency UIs and live-derived tracker values:

- **Weapons / Armor / Tools** are split into dedicated sections instead of one combined checklist.
  - Weapons include broad training toggles (**ALL simple weapons**, **ALL martial weapons**) and per-weapon entries.
  - Armor has explicit **Light / Medium / Heavy / Shield** toggles plus rules reminder text.
  - Tools use a canonical dropdown-backed picker.
- **Skills are grouped by governing ability** (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA).
  - Expertise implies proficiency.
  - Clearing proficiency also clears expertise for that skill.
  - Skill bonus display is derived from `ability_mod + proficiency_bonus (+ proficiency_bonus again for expertise)`.
- **Passive Perception is auto-recalculated live** in the editor from
  - `10 + wis_mod + proficiency_bonus (if Perception proficient) + proficiency_bonus (if Perception expertise)`.
  - The formula display is read-only and updates whenever WIS, PB, or Perception proficiency/expertise changes.
- **Hit Dice include a per-die runtime tracker** in Vitals.
  - Die rows are derived from class levels (e.g., multiclass can produce d12 + d6 rows).
  - Each row tracks max and remaining values in `vitals.hit_dice_tracker` while preserving existing `vitals.hit_dice` compatibility fields.

`campaign` and `ip` remain valid YAML root fields for compatibility, but are hidden in the web form UI and passed through unchanged when present in existing character files.
